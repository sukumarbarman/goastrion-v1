    // SECTION: What is ShubhDin
    whatIsTitle: "What is ShubhDin?",
    whatIsBody: `
ShubhDin is a Vedic timing system that highlights supportive windows — days and months where your planetary combinations feel lighter, smoother, and more aligned with your goals. It does not predict events. It simply shows periods where effort, clarity, and outcomes tend to flow better based on your personal chart.

The core idea is simple:
• Every action has a better and harder time.
• Your Moon, Saturn cycle, Dasha, and transit context shape your “inner weather”.
• When the inner weather improves, your work feels more aligned.

    // SECTION: How GoAstrion calculates
    howCalcTitle: "How GoAstrion Calculates ShubhDin",
    howCalcBody: `
GoAstrion uses a multi-layer Vedic process instead of generic Panchang rules:

1. Your sidereal birth chart (Lahiri ayanamsa)
2. Moon strength, dignity, and daily lunar condition
3. Saturn’s current phase (Sade Sati / transit influence)
4. Vimshottari Mahadasha + Antardasha alignment
5. Daily transit score relative to your natal chart
6. Dignity shifts (Uccha, Neecha, combustion, retrograde)
7. Tithi + Nakshatra + weekday impact
8. Lagna lord transits through key houses

Each day or window is scored based on supportiveness, stability, energy, clarity, and long-term alignment.

    // SECTION: How to use
    howUseTitle: "How to Use ShubhDin",
    howUseBody: `
ShubhDin is not about predicting “what will happen”. It is about choosing:
• When to act
• When to wait
• When to push harder
• When to avoid unnecessary stress

Typical use cases:
• Job change planning
• Interview dates
• Property purchase
• Marriage discussions
• New business or partnership
• Travel planning
• Education, exams, or skill building
• Emotional sensitivity days to avoid conflict

Green windows mean: supportive, smooth, stable
Yellow windows: cautious, evaluate slowly
Red days: avoid commitments or emotionally loaded actions

    exampleBody: `
Imagine you are preparing for a job change. You find:
• A 22-day supportive window next month
• Three high-score days inside it
• Two caution days due to Saturn transit

This does NOT mean “you will get a job”.
It simply means:
• Interviews feel clearer
• Your confidence is better
• Mental confusion reduces
• Saturn pressure is lighter

This creates a more supportive environment for success.
