      {
        q: "What is ShubhDin (auspicious day)?",
        a: "ShubhDin is your personalized auspicious window based on Moon context, Saturn backdrop, and your chart. These are time periods where friction is low and clarity is higher—perfect for study, interviews, planning, launching tasks, or simply moving important work ahead with less resistance. GoAstrion highlights clean windows by avoiding heavy station days and retro overlaps, giving you practical timing support.",
      },
      {
        q: "How does GoAstrion plan for the next 2 years?",
        a: "We compute your birth chart using sidereal calculations, convert it to UTC/IST accurately, and then scan two years ahead. We evaluate lunar phases, Saturn context, station days, retro overlaps, and several friction indicators to highlight calm, supportive days. Unlike generic horoscopes, GoAstrion uses personalized timing logic aligned to your chart, offering actionable next-2-year guidance.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is Saturn · Sade Sati and how should I use it?",
        a: "Sade Sati is a ~7.5-year cycle around your Moon sign where Saturn teaches structure, discipline, and responsibility. At GoAstrion, we treat it as a phase of alignment—pruning distractions, simplifying life, and building strong routines. Instead of fear-based predictions, we show clear timelines, caution days, retro overlaps, and station periods so you can pair effort with supportive days and navigate the cycle confidently.",
      },
      {
        q: "What are ‘station’ or ‘retro overlap’ cautions in the app?",
        a: "Station days occur when Saturn appears to pause before turning retrograde or direct. These days bring slower momentum and require careful planning—avoid high-risk commitments, double-check paperwork, and finalize ongoing tasks. Retro overlaps are excellent for reviews, revisions, learning, re-planning, and fixing issues. GoAstrion flags these days so you can act accordingly.",
      },
    ],

    items: [
      {
        q: "Why should I use GoAstrion?",
        a: "GoAstrion transforms your birth details into a clear, structured guidance system. It gives you personalized ShubhDin (good days), insights on career/finance/health, skills you naturally excel at, and practical timing based on MD/AD periods. Instead of vague astrology, GoAstrion focuses on clarity, discipline, and actionable steps that genuinely help you progress.",
      },

      {
        q: "Is the birth chart free?",
        a: "Yes. Creating your basic Vedic chart, Life Wheel, and skill summary is completely free. You can generate unlimited charts. Some advanced tools—like pro-grade timing dashboards or deeper Dasha analytics—may be added later, but the core experience will stay free.",
      },

      {
        q: "Do you support Vedic astrology and North Indian charts?",
        a: "Absolutely. GoAstrion uses sidereal (Vedic) calculations and renders charts in the North Indian style. MD/AD periods, Sade Sati timelines, Moon context, and aspects are all based on classical Vedic principles combined with modern usability.",
      },

      {
        q: "What details do I need to generate my chart?",
        a: "You only need date of birth, time of birth, and birthplace. You may enter latitude/longitude for precision, but choosing your city is usually enough. GoAstrion automatically calculates time zone and daylight offsets wherever needed.",
      },

      {
        q: "Why is accurate birth time important?",
        a: "Birth time affects the Lagna (Ascendant), which changes every ~2 hours. Even a shift of 10–20 minutes can alter the house placements, which influence domain scores (Career, Finance, Marriage, Health) and timing predictions. If your time is approximate, use a nearby 15-minute estimate—GoAstrion still gives reliable high-level timing context.",
      },

      {
        q: "What is the Life Wheel?",
        a: "Life Wheel is your 360º view of major life domains. It scores Career, Finance, Health, Marriage, and more based on your chart’s planetary support. These scores help you see where small efforts will compound into big results. Each score comes with a practical one-line interpretation, making it easy to act on.",
      },

      {
        q: "What are Skills in GoAstrion?",
        a: "Skills reflect natural tendencies like Analytical Thinking, Communication, Focus, Entrepreneurial Drive, or Leadership. They are extracted from planetary positions, house strengths, and element balance. Skills help you lean into strengths—use them in work, study, interviews, and personal improvement.",
      },

      {
        q: "How do MD (Maha Dasha) and AD (Antar Dasha) influence my life?",
        a: "MD sets the long-term backdrop (5–20 years), shaping themes and priorities. AD determines the immediate flavor (months to a few years). GoAstrion shows your active MD/AD period, the next one coming, and how it influences your timing. This helps you align effort with the natural flow of planetary periods.",
      },

      {
        q: "How does the ShubhDin algorithm work?",
        a: "ShubhDin combines several factors: Moon strength, clean aspects, absence of heavy Saturn events, personal chart context, time window pressure, and retrograde cycles. It filters out high-friction days and highlights supportive windows within the next 14 days or next 2 years. The goal is simple: give you time periods where execution becomes easier.",
      },

      {
        q: "Is Sade Sati dangerous?",
        a: "Not inherently. Sade Sati is often dramatized, but in practice it brings responsibility, discipline, and restructuring. Many people experience maturity, career growth, and stability during this period. GoAstrion shows exact dates, pressure points, and supportive windows so you’re prepared rather than anxious.",
      },

      {
        q: "How does timezone selection work?",
        a: "If you were born in India, choose IST. If born elsewhere, choose the local time zone used at your place of birth. GoAstrion handles UTC conversion internally, ensuring your chart and timing remain accurate across all countries.",
      },

      {
        q: "Can I generate charts for friends and family?",
        a: "Yes! You can create unlimited charts for anyone—family, friends, clients, or students. Some users maintain small groups for study circles or professional consultations.",
      },

      {
        q: "What languages does GoAstrion support?",
        a: "Currently English, Hindi, and Bengali are supported. Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, and international languages are coming soon.",
      },

      {
        q: "Is latitude/longitude required?",
        a: "It's optional. If you choose a city, GoAstrion automatically assigns coordinates. You can manually enter lat/lon for precision, especially if your birthplace is a village or unlisted town.",
      },

      {
        q: "How accurate are ShubhDin predictions?",
        a: "ShubhDin windows are not predictions—they are *supportive timing windows*. They don’t guarantee success but reduce resistance and improve flow. We prioritize clean Moon days, low friction, and stable planetary context, giving you a practical timing advantage.",
      },

      {
        q: "Can GoAstrion replace a professional astrologer?",
        a: "GoAstrion is a clarity tool—fast, structured, and modern. It gives you reliable timing, insights, and summaries, but complex life situations may still need a professional astrologer. Think of GoAstrion as your daily planning assistant, not a replacement for deep personal consultations.",
      },

      {
        q: "Will GoAstrion add more features?",
        a: "Yes. Upcoming features include personalized daily context, career-year progression, birth-time refinement, relationship timing, solar return insights, and pro dashboards. Your feedback helps shape these features.",
      },

      {
        q: "Where should I start as a beginner?",
        a: "Begin at the Create page → generate your chart → explore Life Wheel → view Skills → finally open Saturn and Dasha timelines. This gives you a complete foundation of who you are, where your strengths lie, and how the next 2–3 years unfold.",
      },
