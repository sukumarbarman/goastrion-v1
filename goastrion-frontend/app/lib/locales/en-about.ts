      title: "Our Story & Mission",
      body:
        "GoAstrion was born from a simple observation — astrology, though ancient and profound, is often either mystified or misused. People turn to it during uncertainty, but what they receive is usually fear or fatalism. We wanted to change that.",
      extra:
        "Our team started with a question: What if astrology could be used like weather forecasting — a practical, time-based guidance system? That question led to GoAstrion — a platform where Saturn cycles, Moon transits, and planetary Dashas are translated into simple, everyday decisions. Whether you’re choosing a subject, preparing for an interview, or planning a new start, GoAstrion helps you understand the timing — so your actions are aligned, not accidental.",
      body2:
        "Behind every calculation lies a mix of traditional Vedic algorithms and precise astronomical data. We use open-source ephemeris engines, real-time time zone conversions, and a clean interface that makes complex astrology feel modern, visual, and empowering.",
      note:
        "GoAstrion isn’t about “predicting fate” — it’s about decoding the environment you’re already in. Our goal is to make astrology something you use, not something you fear.",
